# hw-1-Code-Refactor

## Starter code for Horiseon website was given for refactoring.

## Followings were modified to refactor existing code:
* Class selectors are consolidated accoriding their properties.
* Non-semantic elements are changed to semantic elements(header/section/figure/footer/aside) to increase accessibility.
* Comments are added to CSS file.
* Proper indentation is added.
* alt is added to each image file.
* Figure element is added to html.

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance after refactoring (same as the appearance before refactoring):
